As an Aeronautical Engineer with a master’s in Computer-Aided Geometry Algorithms, I’ve soared through the skies of engineering, diving deep into the oceans of subsea/offshore construction, and navigating the complexities of hydrodynamics, structural engineering, computational dynamics, and numerical analysis. My passion for programming and digital technologies fuels my journey of exploration and innovation.

Thank you so much for your valuable time spending on my site and my writings.
